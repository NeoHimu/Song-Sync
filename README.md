# Song-Sync
This project is intended to check if a song is played at mutiple mobile devices at the same time (upto precision of milliseconds), can they act as a big loudspeaker? I installed this app on two mobile devices and set a time when the song should be played. When that time reached, song started to play on both the devices and effective sound level of both the mobile devices is farely larger than the single device. But the combined song was not giving pleasant experience. I think its because song processing takes time and the amount of time taken to process the song by one mobile device might be different than the time taken to process the song by the another mobile device. There is a possibility of fixing this problem and that is if we somehow know which mobile phone takes how much time to process the song. This needs lots of testing and with many other devices. According a delay can be added in the app to get a pleasant experience. I hope that someday some brilliant and bright software person will come and fix this and might go for his own startup :)
